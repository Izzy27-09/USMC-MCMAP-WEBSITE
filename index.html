    <h2 class="center" id="what-mcmap">What Is MCMAP?</h2>
    <p>The Marine Corps Martial ARTS Program(MCMAP) is a combat system developed by the United States Marine Corps to
        combine existing and new hand-to-hand and close quarters combat techniques with morale and team-building
        functions and instruction in the warrior ethos.</p>

    <h2 class="center" id="his-mcmap">History of MCMAP</h2>
    <p>The Marine Corps was born during the battles that created this country. Drawing upon the experiences of the first
        Marines we have developed a martial culture unrivaled in the world today. This legacy includes not only our
        fighting prowess but also the character and soul of what makes us unique as Marines.</p>

    <p>Beginning with the Continental Marines who were renowned as sharpshooters in the rigging of Navy ships, to their
        skill as boarding and landing parties where the sword and bayonet were the tools of their trade, Marines have
        continued to develop and hone their martial skills up to the twentieth century. During World War I the skill of
        the bayonet was supplemented with the first training in unarmed techniques to meet the challenges of trench
        warfare. This training continued to evolve up to World War II. During these early years the leadership and core
        values training that are our hallmark today developed in concert with the martial skills. Guided by visionary
        leaders, the Marine Corps developed a spirit that we know today as honor, courage and commitment.</p>

    <p>As World War II burst upon the Corps, individuals and units were developing specialized training based upon the
        experiences of Marines from the inter-war years. This included exposure of Marines to far eastern martial arts
        systems such as judo and karate. These various systems such as Combat Hittings Skills, the O'Niel System and
        those of the Marines Raiders were employed by Marines during the island hopping campaigns. Additionally, the
        rapid expansion of the Marine Corps saw a refinement of our character and leadership development programs.</p>

    <p>This trend continued after World War II through the post Vietnam war period. Marines tested and refined new
        techniques. We adapted to the technologies and the innovation of a new generation of Marines. During the 1970's
        and 1980's in response to changes in society after Vietnam, focus was on professional military education and
        structured leadership training. The 1980's saw the development of the Linear Infighting Neural Override
        Engagement (LINE) system. The LINE system, developed in response to a perceived need for a standardized close
        combat system, was an important step in the evolution of a Marine Corps specific martial arts program. The LINE
        and it's descendents continued to grow and develop over the past 20 years. In 1996, a review of the LINE system,
        combat hitting skills, pugil stick training and lessons learned from past programs were combined with the input
        of 10 subject matter experts (SMEs) from numerous martial arts disciplines to develop the Marine Corps Close
        Combat Program. This program combined all aspects of close combat into one program. This parralled a similar
        process in 1996 which saw the formalized development of a Core Values training program.</p>

    <p>Upon assuming the Commandancy in June 1999, General James L. Jones detailed his vision of a Marine Corps Martial
        Arts Program. With the Commandant's guidance the Close Combat program, as well as avialable programs outside the
        Marines Corps, underwent a period of testing and review. From this testing and evaluation came the Marine Corps
        Martial Arts Program. The Marine Corps Martial Arts Program evolved into its present day form by combining the
        best combat-tested martial arts skills, time-honored Close Combat training techniques, with proven Marine Corps
        Core Values and Leadership training. The Marine Corps Martial Arts Program is like Marines, unique.</p>

    <h2 class="center" id="over-mcmap">Overview</h2>
    <p>There are 5 belts in total going in the order of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>TAN</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>GRAY</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>GREEN</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>BROWN</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>BLACK</li>
    </ul>


    <p> An instructor is someone who has passed the instructor test and wears a TAN tab on their belt which can only be
        obtained from GREEN belt and onwards. The person who tests persons to become an instructor is called an
        Instructor Trainer and they are desinated with a red tab on their belts instead of TAN. It should be known that
        the only way to accquire a red tab is by being a black belt. For the purpose of this website we shall only be
        going over moves from TAN to Green.</p>
