    <p>Welcome to the Grey Belt! You will find technique information below</p>

    <h1>What is the Grey Belt</h1>
    <p class="indent">The gray belt is a belt recived after the Tan belt. "The gray belt focuses on ground fighting, combining close-quarter combat techniques, hand to hand fighting and instruction to the Warrior Ethos. It also promotes character development and teamwork through the three MCMAP disciplines: mental, physical and character. To get to gray belt, a Marine is required to about six hours of sustainment from the previous belt. On the last day of training, the students are tested for previous belt knowledge and must demonstrate gray belt techniques and tie-ins (i.e. ethics, morals, Corps values) with at least 80 percent accuracy." - America's Navy Press.

    <p><strong>TOTAL LESSON TIME:</strong>1 hour</p>

    <h3>Disrupt And Thrust While Closing With A Static Aggressor</h3>
    <!--Client provided-->
    <p><img src="images/closing.png" alt="Man approaching another man with rifle" width="750" height="828">Source:<cite><a href = "https://www.fitness.marines.mil/Martial-Arts-Instructor/">MCMAP</a></cite><br>1. Assume the modified basic warrior stance approximately 20 to 30 feet away from the aggressor.<br>
        2. Approach the aggressor by moving at a fast walk, using your legs to absorb the impact of your steps. Ensure the bayonet stays locked on the aggressor and it is not bouncing as you move.<br>
        3. As you reach the critical distance of 5 to 10 feet from the aggressor you will use a burst of speed to close the final distance in a controlled aggressive manner.<br>4. While closing, disrupt the aggressor’s weapon by rotating your body slightly to the right, moving their bayonet slightly off line. You only need to redirect the aggressor’s weapon a couple of inches to have the weapon miss your body. This will give your blade a clear path to your primary target.<br>5. Enter by stepping forward and thrusting the blade of the weapon directly into the target. Continue to drive through the aggressor.<br>Additional Help Video<br>
        6. Retract to the modified basic warrior stance, scan the area for additional threats, and prepare for follow on attacks.<br>

        3. At the same time, block the aggressor's left leg with the meaty portion of your left forearm. Do not bend down or reach for the block. If the kick is below your waist, keep your hands up while you move out of the way of the attack.<br>
        4. Follow through by applying pressure against the aggressor's leg to redirect the strike and throw the aggressor off balance.<br>
        5. Execute at least three effective follow-on techniques to the aggressor's vulnerable target areas to end the fight.<br>

<strong>Purpose:</strong>The purpose of weapons of opportunity is to use anything on the battlefield to inflict maximum damage on the aggressor.<br>
<strong>Target Areas:</strong>The objective with a weapon of opportunity is to attack vital target areas readily accessible such as the face, neck, torso, and groin. The extremities are secondary targets that are not immediately fatal, but will often open up fatal target areas.</p>

    2. Grab the aggressor's gear or clothing on their upper torso and pull them down close to you, while thrusting your hips upward. This off-balances the aggressor and will cause him to extend his arms in front of him and place his hands on the ground to regain his balance.<br>
    3. With your right arm, over hook your aggressor’s arm, from the inside around to the outside, above his elbow causing him to bend his elbow.<br>4. Draw your elbow in and drive the knuckles of your right hand into his chest to bring him down close to you.<br>
    5. With your right foot, hook the aggressor's left leg or ankle to prevent him from using his leg to base out.<br>
    6. With your left hand, strike the aggressor's right side and push off with your left leg to roll the aggressor off of you to your right side. Avoid being pulled into the aggressor’s guard by bridging at a 45 degree angle over your right shoulder.<br>
    7. Maintain control of the aggressor’s hooked arm and go to a squatting position on his left side. The aggressor should be lying on his right side.<br>
    8. Keep pressure on the aggressor’s hip with your left knee and use your hands (palm-to-palm or figure-four) to apply pressure against the aggressor’s left elbow. Forcefully turn to your right and arch your back as you rise to break the aggressor’s arm and/or shoulder.<br>
