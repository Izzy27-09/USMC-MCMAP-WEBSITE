    <p><strong>Total Lesson time:</strong> 2 hours 25 minutes<br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong>The purpose of bayonet techniques is to disable or kill an aggressor<br>
        <strong>Target Areas:</strong>The primary target areas of the body are the aggressors throat, groin, or face.
        The aggressor’s torso can be another target area if it is not protected by body armor.<br>
        <strong>Striking Surface:</strong>Thrusts will use the point of the bayonet and slashes will use the cutting
        edge of the bayonet. Buttstrokes will use the toe of the buttstock off the rifle and smashes will use the butt
        of the rifle

    <p><strong>TOTAL LESSON TIME:</strong> 1 hour 45 minutes<br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of upper body strikes is to stun the aggressor or to set him up for follow
        on techniques.<br>
        <strong>Target Areas:</strong> Target areas that should be attacked with upper body strikes are soft tissue
        areas such as the eyes, nose, jaw, and throat. The torso can also be attacked as a secondary target. Pinpoint
        accuracy is not necessary to attack these areas. Strikes use gross motor skills as opposed to fine motor skills.

    <h3>LOWER BODY STRIKES</h3>
    <p><strong>TOTAL LESSON TIME:</strong> 1 hour 45 minutes<br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of lower body strikes is to stop an aggressor’s attack or create an
        opening in his defense in order to launch an attack.<br>
        <strong>Target Areas:</strong> The primary target areas for lower body strikes are the lower extremities, the
        groin, and the lower torso. Never kick high because this jeopardizes your balance and leaves you vulnerable to a
        counter attack. The head is only a primary target area if the aggressor is on the ground or bent over.<br>

                the sweep</li>
            <li>At the same time, grab the aggressor’s right wrist with your left hand and his left shoulder with your right

            <li>Raise your right knee waist high and bring your foot behind the aggressor's right leg. The leg should be bent
                at the knee because it takes less movement than straightening the leg prior to the sweep. When your leg is
                raised you should be balanced while the aggressor is off-balance</li>
            <li>Sweep through the aggressor’s leg, making contact with your calf on the aggressor's calf. At the same
                time,continue to pull the aggressor’s right wrist and push his left shoulder</li>
            <li>Drive the aggressor to the deck by bending at the waist, and following through his leg with the sweep.

    <h3 id="kn-tech">KNIFE TECHNIQUES</h3>
    <p><strong>TOTAL LESSON TIME:</strong>1 hour 30 minutes<br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong>The purpose of knife techniques is to kill the aggressor or cause enough damage to stop
        his attack.<br>
        <strong>Target Areas:</strong>The objective in a knife fight is to attack vital target areas readily accessible
        such as the face, neck, torso, and groin. The extremities are secondary targets that are not immediately fatal,
        but will often open up fatal target areas, or become fatal if left unattended.

        2. Thrust your right hand out and bring the weapon straight down on the aggressor.<br>
        3. Continue dragging the knife down through the aggressor's body. Maintain contact on the aggressor's body with
        the blade of the knife. The slashing motion follows a vertical line straight down through the target.<br>
