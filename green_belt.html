        Belt." - USMC OFFICER

    <h1>HOW TO OBTAIN THE GREEN BELT</h1>
    <p>To obtain the green belt you need 17.65 hours of training and a minimum of 8 hours of sustainment. You will be
        tested for previous belt knowledge and will be expected to know previous and current belt knowledge. </p>

    <h3>Disrupt And Thrust While Closing With A Moving Aggressor</h3>

    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Assume the modified basic warrior stance approximately 30 to 40 feet away from the aggressor.</li>
        <li>You and the aggressor will approach each other by moving at a fast walk, using your legs to absorb the
            impact of your steps. Ensure the bayonet stays locked on the aggressor and it is not bouncing as you move.
        </li>
        <li>As you reach the critical distance of 5 to 10 feet from the aggressor you will use a burst of speed to close
            the final distance in a controlled aggressive manner</li>
        <li>While closing, disrupt the aggressor’s weapon by rotating your body slightly to the right, moving their
            bayonet slightly off line. You only need to redirect the aggressor’s weapon a couple of inches to have the
            weapon miss your body. This will give your blade a clear path to your primary target.</li>
        <li>Enter by stepping forward and thrusting the blade of the weapon directly into the target. Continue to drive
            through the aggressor.</li>
        <li>Retract to the modified basic warrior stance, scan the area for additional threats, and prepare for follow
            on attacks.</li>

        <li>Assume the modified basic warrior stance approximately 20 to 30 feet away from the aggressor.</li>
        <li>Execute your approach and close on the aggressor.</li>
        <li>While closing, execute a straight thrust. This thrust is interrupted by the aggressor’s weapon (such as
            front-sight assemblies catching on each other).</li>
        <li>Once your weapon has been interrupted, move forward right while executing a horizontal or vertical
            buttstroke.</li>
        <li>Step forward with your left foot executing a slash, followed by a straight thrust.</li>
        <li>Retract to the modified basic warrior stance, scan the area for additional threats, and prepare for follow
            on attacks.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Begin facing the aggressor in the basic warrior stance.</li>
        <li>The aggressor executes a rear hand punch. Execute a forward left angle of movement and block the aggressor’s
            arm inboard with your left forearm.</li>
        <li>Bring your right arm underneath the aggressor's right arm and place your radius bone across the aggressor’s
            left carotid artery. Your right palm should be face down with fingers extended and your thumb pointing
            toward you.</li>
        <li>Reach around the back of the aggressor’s neck with your left hand and clasp your hands together, left hand
            palm up. The aggressor’s right arm should be over your right shoulder.</li>
        <li>Pull the aggressor toward your chest, exerting pressure on his left carotid artery with your right radius
            bone. At the same time, push up with your shoulder and head against the aggressor’s triceps, driving his
            right shoulder into his right carotid artery.</li>
        <li>Your shoulder and head should be placed high on the triceps close to the armpit to drive the shoulder
            effectively. Ensure pressure is applied to both sides of the neck and not the trachea or windpipe.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Rotate on the ball of your right foot and bring your left foot inside the aggressor’s feet. Your heels
            should be together and your knees should be bent.</li>
        <li>At the same time, hook your right arm under the back of the aggressor’s right arm, pinching his triceps with
            your biceps, and pull him in close to you. Your backside and hip should be lower than and outside your
            aggressor’s hips and in a position of leverage.</li>
        <li>Pull your aggressor’s right arm across your body and slightly lift the aggressor off the deck by bending at
            the waist, straightening your legs, and rotating your body to your left. If the aggressor cannot be easily
            lifted, your body position is incorrect.</li>
        <li>Drive the aggressor to the deck by forcing him over your hip and following through with the throw.</li>
        <li>Rapidly return to the basic warrior stance.</li>

        <li>At the same time, block the aggressor's right arm with the meaty portion of both forearms. Block at the
            aggressor’s biceps and forearm with the force of a strike.</li>

            pinching it between your bicep and torso.</li>
        <li>At the same time, execute an inside/reverse knife hand strike to the right side of the aggressor’s neck with

        <li>Execute a forward left angle of movement, moving inside the aggressor’s attacking leg.</li>
        <li>At the same time, block the aggressor's right leg with the meaty portion of both forearms. Do not bend down
            or reach for the block. If the kick is below your waist, keep your hands up while you move into the attack.
        </li>
        <li>Wrap your left arm over the aggressor’s attacking leg, at or below the knee and trap it between your bicep
            and torso.</li>
        <li>Forcefully grasp and push the aggressor’s upper torso with your right hand to off balance him.</li>

            leg to maintain balance.</li>
        <li>Always keep your hands up to protect yourself, and keep in mind it is difficult to change the direction of a
            kick after it is initiated.</li>
        <li>Make contact on the aggressor’s abdomen with the ball of your right foot, thrusting your hips forward to
